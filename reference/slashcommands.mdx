title: SlashCommand Reference
---

Welcome to our Slash Command Reference Guide, a comprehensive resource designed to streamline your workflow in Wave using intuitive commands.
Here, you'll find detailed explanations on how to manage various settings and configurations in Wave related to sessions and windows, client settings, editing and viewing files inline, and much more.

## Basic Usage
Slash commands are special commands that begin with a forward slash (`/`), used to perform specific actions or access certain features within Wave. These commands can be executed *with* or *without* the leading slash.

The basic structure of a slash command is as follows:

```
[meta-command] /command [options]
```
### Meta-Commands
Meta-commands are *optional*, special instructions that modify the behavior or appearance of the command they precede. You can think of meta-commands as flags or parameters that fine-tune the functionality of a command.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title = "Using Meta-Commands">
Meta-commands should always be enclosed in square brackets (`[]`), whether you're using a single meta-command or multiple ones.

When using a *single* meta-command, simply enclose it in square brackets before the main command:

```
[lang=json] /codeedit file.json
```
When using *multiple* meta-commands, include them within the same pair of square brackets, separated by a space:

```
[lang=json minimap=0] /codeedit file.json
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Available SlashCommands
---
## /bookmarks
Commands related to managing bookmarks.

### /bookmarks:show

Display all bookmarks.

## /chat
Ask the AI-assistant an [ad-hoc] question from the terminal.

```
Usage:
/chat How do I resolve a merge conflict?
```
<Tip>
For interactive sessions, use the "Wave AI" button in the command box, or use the shortcut `ctrl + space
</Tip>

## /clear

Clear all commands from the current window.

```
Usage:
/clear
```

## /client

Commands that allow you to change and show client settings and information.

### /client:set

This command is used to update client settings.

```
Usage:
/client:set [aiapitoken=token] [aibaseurl=url] [aimaxchoices=choices] [aimaxtokens=tokens] [aimodel=modelname] [termfontfamily=fontfamily] [termfontsize=fontsize]
```
**Options:**

- `aiapitoken` - Set your OpenAI API token to use the OpenAI API directly instead of the Wave cloud servers.
- `aibaseurl` - Set the base URL for the OpenAI API if you want to use a different endpoint or a third-party API compatible with the OpenAI API.
- `aimaxchoices` -  Specify the maximum number of choices to generate when using the OpenAI API. Note that this option only applies when using your own API token. If you're using Wave's proxy, this value is predetermined.
- `aimaxtokens` - Set the maximum number of tokens to use when generating a response from the OpenAI API. Note that this option is only effective when using your own API token. If you're using Wave's proxy, the maxtokens value is preconfigured.
- `aimodel` - Choose the OpenAI language model to use for generating responses. Default is *gpt-3.5-turbo*.
- `aitimeout` - Specify the maximum time to wait (in seconds) for a response from the AI service before timing out. Default value is 10.
- `termfontfamily` - Update the font family used in the terminal. Wave supports *JetBrains Mono*, *Hack*, and *Fira Code* out of the box. You can also use any fixed-width font installed on your local machine by specifying its exact name. Be cautious when setting a custom font, as mistyping the font name or using a non-fixed-width font may result in visual inconsistencies.
- `termfontsize` - Update the font size used in the terminal. You can set the font size from 8 to 15 pixels (px).


**Note:** The `aimaxtokens` and `aimaxchoices` options are only applicable when using your own OpenAI API token. If you're using Wave's built-in proxy for API requests, these values are predetermined to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.

### /client:show

This command displays various client settings and version information.

**Properties:**

- `arch` - The architecture of your host system.
- `client-version` - The version number of your Wave client.
- `clientid` - The identifier for your specific Wave client instance.
- `db-version` - The version of the client's database.
- `aiapitoken` - Your OpenAI API token.
- `aibaseurl` - The URL used for sending OpenAI queries.
- `aimaxchoices` - The maximum number of choices returned when querying OpenAI.
- `aimaxtokens` - The maximum number of tokens currently set for OpenAI queries.
- `aimodel` - OpenAI model name.
- `releasecheck` - Shows if automatic release checks are active (on/off).
- `server-version` - The version of the Wave server you're connected to.
- `telemetry` - Indicates whether telemetry is enabled (on/off).
- `termfontfamily` - The font family currently used for your terminal text.
- `termfontsize` - The current size of the terminal font.
- `userid` - Your unique user identifier.

<Tip>
See [client:set](#client-set) for more information on how to set the user-modifiable settings.

## /codeedit

View and edit files inline using rich native UI. Includes syntax highlighting, code folding, and completion.

```
Usage:
/codeedit [filename]

[lang=language] /codeedit [filename]
[minimap=0] /codeedit [filename]

[lang=language minimap=0] /codeedit [filename]
```

**Options:**
- `filename` - Name of the file you'd like to edit. Filename resolves against the current remote and current working directory.

[Meta-commands:](#meta-commands)

- `minimap` - Controls the visibility of the minimap in the scrollbar. Set to `0` to disable.

**Shortcuts:**

**Note:** Codeedit also includes a live preview feature for Markdown files. To activate, open a Markdown file in Codeedit and click the `show preview` button located in the top right corner. This feature enables simultaneous editing and rendering, offering a side-by-side view of your Markdown source and its live output for efficient and immediate feedback.

You can also specify a signal by number like this:

```

/signal [line-arg] 9
```
## /sleep
Pauses the execution of the next command for a specified duration in milliseconds.

```
Usage:
/sleep 500
```
This command is largely used for debugging, but should be used in lieu of your systems *sleep* when creating [custom keybindings](/reference/customKeybindings) that contain multiple commands in Wave. This is due to the fact that in it's current implementation, the keybinding frontend code doesn't have a built-in mechanism to determine when a command has finished executing. As a result, if commands are executed in rapid succession without any delay, it may lead to unexpected behavior or commands being executed out of order.

## /telemetry

Commands that deal with client telemetry.

### /telemetry:on

Turn telemetry on.

### /telemetry:off

Turn telemetry off.

### /telemetry:send

Force a send of current telemetry to server.

## Other
Miscellaneous commands for debugging, behind-the-scenes tasks, typically beyond regular workflow usage.

### /_killserver

Kills the local prompt server (and restarts it). Used for debugging.

### /_compgen

Handles command completion.
