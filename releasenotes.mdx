### v0.7.0 - 03/7/2024

Major Release of Wave Terminal, featuring a new UI, new connections backend, optional auto-update, Linux packages, light mode, and a *lot* of smaller features, fixups, and bug fixes.  Over 100 pull-requests were merged since v0.6.  We have the groundwork in place for customizable themes, full terminal font customization, and custom keybindings which all should arrive shortly in the v0.7.x series.  The new connection framework will also enable us to deliver a new set of productivity features.

As always, we appreciate all feedback and suggestions.  Please let us know what you think in Discord, file bugs/enhancements on Github, and give us a star on Github if you'd like to support us!

* **New UI** - Moved to a cleaner, flat design.  Less visual clutter, and updated colors to help you focus on the commands and output.
    * Left sidebar is now fully collapsable (for those who would like a cleaner terminal experience)
    * Command Input now extends the full width of the terminal.  Moved hints/actions into icons at the top-right to keep more pixels for writing commands.
    * UI updates to "Wave AI" panel, and to our inline history search
    * Light Mode Theme (beta)
    * UI Updates for CodeEdit
    * Ability to change between "JetBrains Mono" and "Hack" font for terminal
* **Connections Overhaul** - Connections have entirely been reworked to use Go's standard crypto/ssh library instead of relying on the system's ssh program. This means more predictable behavior across systems and fewer corner cases to handle. This fixes multiple connection related issues, and allows us to handle interactive logins in a much cleaner way using popups for password entry, OTPs, and other server input.
* **Auto-Update** - Wave will now detect and download updates for MacOS and Linux (can be disabled in settings) 
* **Linux Packages** - New packages built for Linux, including .deb, .rpm, AppImage, and pacman
* Bug fix: [github #368](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/368), MacOS paths were getting reordered by MacOS's "path_helper" program.  Fixed zsh session restore sequence to properly exclude global RCS files.
* Bug fix: [github #304](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/304), show Conda environment in prompt
* Bug fix: [github #285](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/285), fixed full-screen mode
* Bug fix: [github #278](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/278), show a warning, and add new slashcommand `/reset:cwd` to help fix the terminal state when your cwd is deleted
* Bug fix: [github #330](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/330), fixed history dropdowns (using new dropdown code)
* Bug fix: [github #150](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/150), commands which exited with non-zero exit codes are now clearly shown with a red background
* Bug fixes related to connections: [github #179](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/179), [github #300](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/300), [github #289](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/289), [github #145](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/145), [github #95](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/95), [github #286](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/286)
* Other assorted bug fixes, enhancements, and performance improvements


### v0.6.3 - 02/19/2024

Patch release to fix [github #302](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/302) which caused the last line of terminal output to be cut off for certain screen zoom settings (system zoom/resolution or in-app zooming.)

### v0.6.2 - 02/14/2024

Quick patch release for a large zsh performance bug where we were re-running the interactive zsh configs for every command execution causing a notable slowdown in performance.

* Bug fix: fixed slow zsh command performance and overeager zsh re-initialization
* Bug fix: fixed ssh config import

### v0.6.1 - 01/31/2024

* Tab/workspace indicators now show if commands are running
* Keybindings fixes for international keyboards and linux. Keybindings now use the same letter key on non-US keyboards. MacOS keybindings that use the "Cmd" key now map to "Alt" (instead of the "Windows" key) on Linux and Windows.
* Restart Command -- use the restart icon, or Cmd-R to restart the selected command.  Restarted commands run with the same directory and environment as when they were first launched.
* Cmd-Shift-R will always restart the most recent command in the tab (no matter which command is selected).
* Can use the mouse to resize and collapse the left sidebar.
* Other bug fixes and improvements

### v0.6.0 - 01/23/2024

* **zsh support**
* Bug fix: International Characters (and emojis!) now display properly in the terminal and when using AI features. [github #88](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/88) [github #190](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/190)
* ChatGPT help with writing commands, use Ctrl-Space from the command prompt.
* Cmd-P tab switcher.  Quickly switch to tabs and workspaces by name (like VSCode's Cmd-P file switcher)
* Zoom - use Cmd +/- to zoom UI in and out (for smaller or larger monitors)
* Clickable Links in Terminal Output (hold Cmd while clicking)
* Tab Indicators - gray/green/red indicator lights show on tabs when running commands have additional output (gray), complete successfully (green), or fail (red).
* Import button added to the Connections Screen to quickly add connections to hosts defined in your .ssh/config file.
* Cmd-D keyboard shortcut to delete the selected command block (also added a trash icon to allow deletion using the mouse)
* Cmd-W keyboard shortcut to close a tab [github #181](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/181)
* Settings is now its own main screen (no longer in a modal)
* A popup now informs users that waveshell (aka mshell) will be installed on remote machines when adding Wave connections
* Allow dots and underscores in connection aliases, allow backslash in ssh usernames, and allow multiple connections to the same machine if they are using different ports.
* Big update to screen/command deletion and history to make it more intuitive.  Clearing or deleting a tab, or deleting a command block no longer removes the affected commands from history.
* New UI for open-source license acknowledgements
* Bug fix: Escape should now close modals and screens
* Bug fix: fixed issue with new connection login screens "flashing" making it impossible to login using passwords and OTPs for certain users [github #213](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/213)
* Bug fix: quote paths to go backends to allow install paths with spaces or special characters
* More useful "Disconnected" Modal that shows the last 50 lines of wavesrv.log for easier error reporting
* Other bug fixes and performance improvements [github #188](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/188)
* Dropped support for linux-arm64 (still supported as a remote connection, but not for the Wave Terminal desktop app)

Note: if you get errors while using zsh, please report them on [github](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues) or in our Discord.  To switch shells in an already open tab run: `reset shell=bash` or `reset shell=zsh`. To reload your rc/init files after editing them (to to just reset your terminal state) run `reset`.
