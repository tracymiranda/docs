### v0.7.6 - 06/17/2024

Minor release with a couple of _major_ features!

* **Wave AI Sidebar** - we've moved Wave AI into a right-handls sidebar that is persistent across tabs/workspaces.  It can be toggled open using Cmd-Shift-Space.  Easily ask questions and use the arrow keys to select blocks to execute directly in your terminal session (completely keyboard controllable).  Note that Wave AI works with BYOLLM so you can easily hook it up to your own local model, or a different cloud model that you subscribe to.
* **New Auto-Complete** - In beta, a new autocomplete system based on Fig's class-leading autocomplete library, integrated with our universal shell history.  To try it out, go to your settings and switch on "Command Autocomplete".
* Bug fix: bumped electron version, fixes auto-update bug on Linux (and more)
* Other keybinding/focus related bug fixes

### v0.7.5 - 05/02/2024

Quick patch release to fix a regression in v0.7.3 where when the completion info window popped up, the cmdinput lost focus (so you couldn't actually complete files/directories).  Similar regression which did not allow you to submit a command when the "info" window was open.

See v0.7.3 release notes.

### v0.7.4 - 05/01/2024

Quick patch release to remove k8s context/namespace from prompt. Fixes a performance issue where the k8s context command might take multiple seconds to run (causing state altering commands to hang for that amount of time)

See v0.7.3 release notes.

### v0.7.3 - 05/01/2024

New sudo support, better theming and keybinding support, with a ton of performance and usability updates (almost 70 PRs have gone into this patch release).

* **Sudo Support** - Seamless sudo support (configurable in settings) for local/remote machines. (will follow-up with detailed documentation)
* Multi-level terminal theming support -- global, workspace, and per tab terminal themes (will follow-up with more detailed documentation)
* Keybinding updates -- including ability to register custom commands
* Light mode fixes and cleanup
* k8s namespace/context added to the prompt
* Block context menu with easy access to copy command and/or output, or easily minimize, delete, or restart commands
* AI: customizable timeouts for AI connections
* AI: cleaned up labels/names now that our AI integration is not tied to Chat-GPT (BYOLLM support)
* UI: light mode fixes and cleanup
* UI: restyled command input box (removed background color / outline)
* UI: restyled some of the command input auxiliary views to be more consistent
* UI: new labels for dropdowns, correctly truncates longer values
* UI: new native context menus for blocks and tabs for quicker access to some functionality

* Other assorted bug fixes, cleanup, and performance improvements

### v0.7.2 - 04/01/2024

Minor release, focused on zsh improvements, keybinding support (beta), and more light mode cleanup.

* Updated Shell Initialization Flow -- now when a new tab is created we reinitialize the shell in an interactive block.  This ensures a new tab is picking up current rc file changes, and it also allows for interactive input during initialization. Before, shell initialization in Wave might fail/hang if it required interactive input (e.g. "Do you want to update oh-my-zsh? (Y/n)").  This update fixes many types of shell initialization bugs that have been reported.
* Many `zsh` fixes, including better zmodload support, better support for prompt variables, working on native prompts, fix accidental setting of readonly variables.
* **Custom Keybinding Support** (beta) - currently implemented as a JSON file in ~/.waveterm/config/keybindings.json.  Working on documentation, please see us in Discord if you want to help test.
* Tab settings is now a pull-down. It automatically closes whenever you run a command (press "return") in the cmdinput box.
* Removed ability to click on "tab settings" for the non-active tab, now clicking anywhere on an inactive tab will switch to that tab.
* Ordering and wording changes for initial "Welcome to Wave" modal.
* Removed date picker from History (functionality was confusing, will return with better date range support)
* Internal: shell state diff changes and improvements to handle new shell startup sequence
* AI: bypass our cloudservers when an AI Base URL is set (allows for base URL support when no API key is specified)
* AI: better prompt used for AI feature to be more compatible with Wave's UI rendering
* UI: light mode cleanup, other small UI fixes
* UI: Theme selector now offers "Light", "Dark", and "System".  System will automatically switch between light/dark mode based on your system settings.
* Left Nav Improvements: Offset icons, new scrollbars, etc.
* Keybindings: fix "Escape" key to close main views and modals everywhere.
* Bug fix: Fixed segfault when known_hosts file doesn't exist or is empty
* Bug fix: always create ~/.mshell/rcfiles directory on startup.  Prevents an issue where that directory might created and owned by root when the first command run was run as "sudo".
* Bug fix: increased maximum size of AI Base URL to 200 characters
* UI Bug fix: fixed some buttons which were still using the old button styles
* Internal: tracking k8s context and namespace (will be added to custom Wave prompt in next release)
* Internal: More flexible command input/output handling ("ephemeral" commands). Used to sync Wave's prompt in the background when switching tabs (e.g. when the git branch may have been changed by a command in a different tab)
* Internal: Testing WebGL support for terminal rendering (working through issues with dispose handler preventing turning setting on more widely)
* Other assorted internal fixups and code reorganization
* Other assorted typos, bug fixes, and improvements.

### v0.7.1 - 03/15/2024

Minor release, mostly focused on cleanup for bugs and quirks that came up in the v0.7.0 release. It also contains two new plugins `pdfview` and `mediaview` which allow you to preview PDF files and play audio/video files inline right inside the terminal.

* Light Mode -- Fixes multiple bugs and quirks found and reported in v0.7.0 (including text selection and cursor color)
* Various SSH/Connection bug fixes (error handling, non-secret interactive prompts, and made the 'user' optional)
* `pdfview [filename]` allows inline viewing of PDF files
* `mediaview [filename]` allows inline playing of audio or video files
* Fix when red error highlight shows on blocks (no longer showing for commands that are killed with Ctrl-C (SIGINT) or from a SIGPIPE).  Also fixes exit code displayed for commands that were killed via a signal
* Converted more keybindings to use the new keybind manager. Any commands that have been migrated to the new keybind manager can have their keyboard shortcuts customized
* Bug fix: fix the Bookmarks view (layout was broken)
* Bug fix: some modals / main screens weren't closing correctly when "ESC" was pressed
* Bug fix: fix LANG environment variable on MacOS when user has a region selected
* Bug fix: imageviewer now shows SVG images correctly

### v0.7.0 - 03/7/2024

Major Release of Wave Terminal, featuring a new UI, new connections backend, optional auto-update, Linux packages, light mode, and a *lot* of smaller features, fixups, and bug fixes.  Over 100 pull-requests were merged since v0.6.  We have the groundwork in place for customizable themes, full terminal font customization, and custom keybindings which all should arrive shortly in the v0.7.x series.  The new connection framework will also enable us to deliver a new set of productivity features.

As always, we appreciate all feedback and suggestions.  Please let us know what you think in Discord, file bugs/enhancements on Github, and give us a star on Github if you'd like to support us!

* **New UI** - Moved to a cleaner, flat design.  Less visual clutter, and updated colors to help you focus on the commands and output.
    * Left sidebar is now fully collapsible (for those who would like a cleaner terminal experience)
    * Command Input now extends the full width of the terminal.  Moved hints/actions into icons at the top-right to keep more pixels for writing commands.
    * UI updates to "Wave AI" panel, and to our inline history search
    * Light Mode Theme (beta)
    * UI Updates for CodeEdit
    * Ability to change between "JetBrains Mono" and "Hack" font for terminal
* **Connections Overhaul** - Connections have entirely been reworked to use Go's standard crypto/ssh library instead of relying on the system's ssh program. This means more predictable behavior across systems and fewer corner cases to handle. This fixes multiple connection related issues, and allows us to handle interactive logins in a much cleaner way using popups for password entry, OTPs, and other server input.
* **Auto-Update** - Wave will now detect and download updates for MacOS and Linux (can be disabled in settings) 
* **Linux Packages** - New packages built for Linux, including .deb, .rpm, AppImage, and pacman
* Bug fix: [github #368](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/368), MacOS paths were getting reordered by MacOS's "path_helper" program.  Fixed zsh session restore sequence to properly exclude global RCS files.
* Bug fix: [github #304](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/304), show Conda environment in prompt
* Bug fix: [github #285](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/285), fixed full-screen mode
* Bug fix: [github #278](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/278), show a warning, and add new slashcommand `/reset:cwd` to help fix the terminal state when your cwd is deleted
* Bug fix: [github #330](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/330), fixed history dropdowns (using new dropdown code)
* Bug fix: [github #150](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/150), commands which exited with non-zero exit codes are now clearly shown with a red background
* Bug fixes related to connections: [github #179](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/179), [github #300](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/300), [github #289](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/289), [github #145](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/145), [github #95](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/95), [github #286](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/286)
* Other assorted bug fixes, enhancements, and performance improvements


### v0.6.3 - 02/19/2024

Patch release to fix [github #302](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/302) which caused the last line of terminal output to be cut off for certain screen zoom settings (system zoom/resolution or in-app zooming.)

### v0.6.2 - 02/14/2024

Quick patch release for a large zsh performance bug where we were re-running the interactive zsh configs for every command execution causing a notable slowdown in performance.

* Bug fix: fixed ssh config import

### v0.6.1 - 01/31/2024

* Tab/workspace indicators now show if commands are running

* Restart Command -- use the restart icon, or Cmd-R to restart the selected command.  Restarted commands run with the same directory and environment as when they were first launched.
* Cmd-Shift-R will always restart the most recent command in the tab (no matter which command is selected).
* Can use the mouse to resize and collapse the left sidebar.
* Other bug fixes and improvements

### v0.6.0 - 01/23/2024

* **zsh support**

* Allow dots and underscores in connection aliases, allow backslash in ssh usernames, and allow multiple connections to the same machine if they are using different ports.
* Big update to screen/command deletion and history to make it more intuitive.  Clearing or deleting a tab, or deleting a command block no longer removes the affected commands from history.
* New UI for open-source license acknowledgements
* Bug fix: Escape should now close modals and screens
* Bug fix: fixed issue with new connection login screens "flashing" making it impossible to login using passwords and OTPs for certain users [github #213](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/213)
* Bug fix: quote paths to go backends to allow install paths with spaces or special characters
* More useful "Disconnected" Modal that shows the last 50 lines of wavesrv.log for easier error reporting
* Other bug fixes and performance improvements [github #188](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/188)
