## The Future of Plugins
Wave's file viewer plugins are just the beginning of our journey to revolutionize the way you interact with files in the terminal.

In the future, we plan to introduce a simple alias like `/view` that will intelligently render any supported file type, eliminating the need to memorize individual commands for each file format and providing a more intuitive and streamlined experience.

Stay tuned for more updates and plugins that will further empower your workflow and boost your productivity within the command-line environment.
